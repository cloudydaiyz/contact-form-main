## Overview

  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about the `<form>` HTML element through completing this project, and what it means to do form validation. It was a bit trickier than I thought at first, as HTML5 comes with default validation that I realized that I didn't want to use for this solution. After a bit of research, this challenge became more straightforward.

### Continued development

If I were to continue this, I would:
- add functionality to submit responses to the specified email
- allow for multiple responses and keep track of response history
- try adding a dropdown for one of the options

### Useful resources

- [HTML Constraint Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation) - Although I didn't use this for my final solution, this could be a helpful resource for when I'm feeling lazier making HTML forms.
